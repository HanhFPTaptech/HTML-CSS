  <h1>Lee Sang Hyeok(이상혁)</h1>
  <p>Hi,this is Sang hyeok"Faker"Lee, the Midlaner for SK Telecom T1. Ever since I was a child, I have allways liked to play games. Except for that, I think I was just an ordinary student. My parents got me a computer, when I was very young. So I played games a lot. League of Legends was official released when I was 3rd grade in middle scholl. I"ve been playing League of Legends since then. I started as a Midlaner. I liked Hoon, the former Midlaner in EDG. I was looking for a champion guide on Ryze, and I found Hoon"s Ryze guide. That is why I liked him in the past. My offical matchup. It was my first time to play in the booth. I just thought to my self:"I"m going to play a game.". And that game I won. I was ranked 1st place on the Korean sever back then. So I had many offers from professional teams.

In 2013, we have BO5 on KT. We lost two game in the series. It was not as bad you may thing was. We knew that we better than them. We knew that we would win the next game. Since we won that game and became
LCK champion, we all knew that we could win that series. The world champion ship meant a lot to us, because we"ve earned that seat in our first year. When we first went against foreign teams, they had very aggressive playstyle. So, we were a little confused at first. But we were able to overcome that by playing against many teams.  Very match felt so different to us. We were able to win 3-0 in the grand finals. We accomplished our goal of wining the world championship. So,those thing are so valuable to us. I still remember the day I raised up the trophy in front of all the fans. That was the most memorable moment for me in 2013. Among all the splits we"ve played, I feel that we were the best in the winter split. we won the grand final in 3-0. We won all games in the series. We were able to show that we have to all the other teams. That is why we can never forget about 2013. When we went to the states, many people actually recognized us. I was really surprised that we had so many foreign fans. who really like us from all over the world. I can allways feel the love from my foreign fans in very match up. But, the most memorable moment was when the fans cheered for me in Paris. We were able to overcome our slump because our fans have been consistently rooting for us. They help us a lot in many ways. That is why we were able to come back. I am really grateful for that. We were able to pull ourselves together because of that. So I hope that our fans continue to cheer for us. We were able to do quite a good job this season. We"re going to try harder to win the grand finals.</p>
